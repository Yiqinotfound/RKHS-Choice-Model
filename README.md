This project contains the experimental code accompanying the paper *RKHS Choice Model*. It implements experiments for choice models using various kernel-based methods. 


**Folder Structure**
- real_data_experiment/: Main folder containing experiment scripts.
- configs/: Configuration files for kernel parameters and experiment settings.
- models/: Model definitions.

**Abbreviations**
- FK: Fixed Kernel RKHS 
- RF: Random Feature 
- NTK: Neural Tangent Kernel 


How to Run Experiments

Set experiment parameters in configs/.

Run the corresponding script in real_data_experiment/.
